This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#change to data directory
setwd("/Users/dfareri/Dropbox/Dominic/Github/fareri-lab/Discounting_Social/ProlificData_MP/")

#read in data file
ITC_Ostracism<-read.csv(file = "SDRD_MasterDataSheet_scored.csv", header = TRUE)

library(plotly)
library(ggstatsplot)

ggbetweenstats(data=ITC_Ostracism,x = Condition,y=Thoughts_.I.was.excluded,plot.type = "violin",type = "nonparametric",pairwise_comparisons=FALSE,results.subtitle = TRUE, ylab = "Subjective Ratings: Exclusion",xlab = "Group (1 = Exclusion, 2 = Inclusion)")
```

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
